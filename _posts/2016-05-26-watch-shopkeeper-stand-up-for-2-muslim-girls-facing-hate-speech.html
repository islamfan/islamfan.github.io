<p>On May 23, 2016, Two Muslim girls wearing the headscarf were enjoying ice cream in an Ice Cream shop in Orange County, California, when a male customer started verbally abusing them with racist comments.</p>

<p>One of the girls Malaak Ammari recorded part of the incident on her phone and shared it on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you just trying to eat your ice cream but trump supporters won&#39;t let you live <a href="https://t.co/rW3MI8a2pn">pic.twitter.com/rW3MI8a2pn</a></p>&mdash; palestina (@itsdatnunu) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsdatnunu/status/734951137531428865">May 24, 2016</a></blockquote>

In the short video, shop employee Jessie Noah refunds the man the money he paid for ice cream and says &#8220;You can give somebody else your business&#8221;. The shop owner's wife Cindy Ramsay is also heard telling him &#8220;If you can't be nice, we don't want you&#8221;.</p>
<p>Walking towards the exit door, the man points to the 2 Muslim girls and says "You refused to serve me because you were serving them. I don't want them near my country."</p>
<p>Malaak Ammari who's recording the video replies &#8220;Too bad, we're here. Sucks for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a threatening tone the man replies &#8220;Sucks for me? You'll see what happens,&#8221; and leaves the shop.</p>

<p>Nura says she shared the video on social media to show that even though Islamophobia is on the rise there are still good people who stand up for what is right. Jessie, the shop employee who stood up to the man's bullying, said she had "never experienced such outward racism before, and felt the need to defend the girls &#8220;To treat them as lesser because of their beliefs is not American,&#8221; she told The Huffington Post.</p>
