<p>
Les groupes extremistes Musulmans reponsables de senseless violence against civilians think they represent true Islam but they are misguided. Most notably ISIS and Al Qaeda will try to justify their actions by citing texts from the Quran. For them the terrorist attacks in New York, London, Paris and Madrid are Islamically lawfull. But examining the text from the Quran quickly shows these people are twisting the scripture to match their own violent ways.
</p>

<p>People in the west point to these terrorist groups to condemn Islam as a religion that promotes violence and terrorism. But the majority of Muslims around the world strongly condemn the acts of these groups and in most cases Muslim people are the ones suffering the most from terrorist attacks.

War in the Quran

Les actions des groupes terroristes can be quickly found in conflict with the teachings of the Quran
The Quran allows war under specific conditions and gives guidelines to follow
1- No pre-emptive war. Only self defense is allowed. Only allowed to fight back when kicked out of their homes and lands [TODO: find verse]
2- Allies are under attack and they ask Muslims for help
3- Two Muslim entities are fighting each other. A third Muslim entity negotiates a truce but one of the two parties does not abide by it.

Guidelines
The enemy stops hostilities and expresses willingness for peace, Quran says Muslims should stop the war
“fight for the cause of God, those who fight you, but do not transgress, for God does not love the transgressors.”
Treatement of POWs
POWs should be treated well. Food etc. they should be exchanged for Muslim prisoners or for Money (source ?)
Enslaving prisoners of war
Cannot convert people by force
Verse: "... those who have not expelled, nor have helped to expel, Muslims from their lands ..."
