<p><strong>Amna Al Haddad just made history: For the first time ever a muslim girl wearing Hijab is featured in Nike's Inner Strength series. Amna is a 26 years old weightlifter from the United Arab Emirates. Here is what she had to say about this opportunity "This is an important moment in history, not for me, but for women empowerment worldwide. Why? To be an athlete from the Middle East, and from the UAE, to be chosen to be featured in Nike recent "inner strength" documentary series as the first woman says a lot about the brand as well as the progress of our country. It is an honor and a big role for me that I am proud of and feel deeply grateful and positive!"</strong></p>

<p>Amna describes how weightlifting changed her life from a depressed and overweight journalist to a professional athlete full of hope and strength. "From there, I started going to the gym normally and then I got into Cross Fit, which changed my view of strength sports for women, and I just fell in love with weightlifting".</p>&#13;
