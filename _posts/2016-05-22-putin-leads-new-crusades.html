<strong>Russia considers the war in Syria as a fight to promote Christianity in the middle East. Indeed Vsevolod Chaplin, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church's Public Affairs Department described Russia's military operations in Syria as "holy war". Here are a few images that the media does not want you to see:

In October 2013, a giant 105 feet tall statue of Jesus Christ was placed on Mount Sedneya in Syria. It can be seen from neighbor countries like Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan.

<strong>
To understand the logic behind Russia's actions in Syria we have to understand President Putin's thinking. In almost all of his major speeches, Putin mentions a Russian political and religious thinker named Ivan Ilyin. Reading Ilyin's work gives us a clear understanding of what really drives Mr Putin.  Ilyin called for religious traditionalism and praised the unique "Russian soul", he considers the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 a disaster and that the only way to recover from it is for Russia to return to Christianity. Indeed after the Russian revolution the Communist Party put an end to the power of the Russian Orthodox Church and marginalized Christianity to a great extent. With the ascension of Putin to power the Church has reclaimed its lost power and Putin has repeatedly shown his allegiance to the church. He calls the Orthodox Church Russia's "spiritual shield" and considers it to be as important as the country's nuclear shield. Putin has once said "We must protect Russia from that which has destroyed American society" referring to the growing liberalisation of America. People close to him say that Putin did not care about Christianity while working for the Soviet spy agency (KGB) but the breakup of the soviet union had a deep impact on him that took him back to Christianity. He is quoted as saying "The breakup of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.". 
<br />Putin's ambitions are not confined to the borders of Russia, he is aspiring to be the leader of Christians all over the world. In January 2012 Putin met with the Patriarch of Moscow's main cathedral and promised him that he will protect Christianity everywhere in the world. </strong>

<strong>In 2014 Putin said in a speech:
&ldquo;Another serious challenge to Russia&rsquo;s identity is linked to events taking place in the world. Here there are both foreign policy and moral aspects. We can see how many of the Euro-Atlantic countries are actually rejecting their roots, including the Christian values that constitute the basis of Western civilization. They are denying moral principles and all traditional identities: national, cultural, religious and even sexual. They are implementing policies that equate large families with same-sex partnerships, belief in God with the belief in Satan.&nbsp; The excesses of political correctness have reached the point where people are seriously talking about registering political parties whose aim is to promote pedophilia. People in many European countries are embarrassed or afraid to talk about their religious affiliations. Holidays are abolished or even called something different; their essence is hidden&nbsp;away, as is their moral foundation. And people are aggressively trying to export this model all over the world. I am convinced that this opens a direct path to degradation and primitivism, resulting in a profound demographic and moral crisis.&rdquo;
