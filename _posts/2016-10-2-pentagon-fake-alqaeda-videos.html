<p>A joint investigation by the british newspaper Sunday Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism has revealed that the US military paid millions of dollars to a PR agency to produce fake videos and attribute them to Al Qaeda during the Iraq war.</p>

<p>The investigation report reveals that the british PR agency 'Bell Pottinger' received half a billion dollars in payments from the Pentagon to manage a secret PR project in Iraq between the years of 2007 and 2011. The agency worked with high ranking US officers in camp victory during a time where Iraq was suffering from unprecedented sectarian violence.</p>
