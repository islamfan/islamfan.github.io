<p>German MP of the National Democratic Party (NDP) of the extreme right, Werner Klawun, converted to Islam at the age of 75 years. Werner, which was previously known by its fierce opposition to immigration and refugees, is now of the biggest supporters of refugees  from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

<p>In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Werner who changed his name to Ibrahim said he wanted to know more about Islam after reading the Eastern Divan and poems of the great German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe praising Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). That led him to read the German translation of the Quran and ultimately accept Islam.</p>

<p>Mr Werner says his ideas have completely changed after his conversion to Islam:
</p>
<blockquote>"It was not enough for me to break the links with my past as a member of a party of extreme right that is anti-Islam and anti-Muslims. I wanted to do greater works to make up for my past. I started to help refugees."
</blockquote>
<p>
Werner Klawun has made the pilgrimage to Mecca. He now lives in peace away from the tumult of the extreme right.
