A friend of the Ali family revealed that Muhammad Ali Jr was detained by immigration at Florida Airport on February 7th.

Muhammad Ali Jr was accompanied by his mother Khalilah Camacho-Ali as they arrived from Jamaica where they attended an event marking Black History Month.

His mom was released after she showed immigration a picture with her ex husband boxer Muhammad Ali. Her son on the other hand was detained for two hours and - despite having a US passport that clearly indicates he was born in the US - was asked questions like "Are you Muslim?", "Where did you get your name from?", "Where were you born". During this time his mom was extremely worried about her son and running through the airport asking for help.
</p>

<p>
The Ali family lawyer Chris Mancini told the Courier Journal of Louisville, Kentucky "It's crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump's efforts to ban Muslims from the United States. Imagine walking into an airport and being asked about your religion. This is classic customs profiling."
