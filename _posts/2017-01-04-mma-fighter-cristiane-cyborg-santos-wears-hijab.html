<blockquote>
"One of the reasons I started my Pink Belt Fitness By Cris Cyborg program was because I saw a need to unite women of all religions, ages, and cultures in a way that they could empower each other and motivate one another to achieve more with a support system!<br>
I am a believer in Jesus Christ and a devout Christian, I am wearing the Hijab, a symbol of modesty and protection used by many women around the world, not as a sign of religion but as a symbol of support for all women around the world. Combat Sports should be an opportunity shared by all!"
