In July 2010, Rachid Nekkaz created a fund for defending the right of Muslim women in wearing the Hijab in Europe. The fund started with one million euros to pay for fines some European governments impose on women who wear the niqab in the streets.

<p>
Although he personally opposes the wearing of Niqab, he nevertheless considers that nobody has the right to prevent a person from wearing the dress of their choice as long as that dress is not a threat to the security or freedom of others. His commitment to this principle has already cost Rachid Nekkaz €245,000: So far se has paid 1146 fines in France, 261 in Belgium, 2 in Holland and 1 fine in Switzerland.

As much as Rachid Nekkaz defends the freedom to wear the Hijab, he also defends the freedom and choice of not wearing it. In September 19, 2013, he travelled to Khartoum in Sudan to urge the Sudanese government to abandon the practice of flogging and support a Muslim woman who was challenging Sudanese law by refusing to wear the hijab.
