I have been winning those championships for the last eight years", she said.</p></blockquote><p>Outside of her home country, her first success was at the mediterranean games of 2011 where she won third place, then she won third place again at Karate championship of European universites in 2015.Amina is currently training for the European championship that will be held in France during the month of May 2016.</p>
