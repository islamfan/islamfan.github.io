<p>Ijaz Farooq a member of the local Muslim community said "Building this church, we want to show that we are untied as a community"</p>
<p>Faryal Masih, a member of the local Christian community and a childhood friend of Farooq said "We live with love, attend each other&#8217;s weddings and festivals, We are together in times of blessings and grief."</p>
