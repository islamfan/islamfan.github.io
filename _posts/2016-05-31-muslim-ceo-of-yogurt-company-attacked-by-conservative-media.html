<h4>
<p>Remember Hamdi Ulukaya? The Muslim self made billionnaire who made healines about a month ago when he offered his 2000 employees 10 percent of the company’s value. It was estimated that the payout for each employee would be beteween $150,000 and $1 million depending on tenure at the company. That's right some of the employees were becoming millionaires all of a sudden. 
The man's story is very inspiring: He was born in a small village in Turkey in 1972, he lived in Turkey until 1994 when he travelled to the US on a student visa. In 2005 he saw a newspaper ad for a 95 years old yogurt factory on sale in upstate New York and decided to buy it. He hired five employees and got into the yogurt industry with no prior experience. Today his company is worth billions of dollars.

The American conservative media does not like Ulukaya efforts helping refugees around the world and especially those fleeing the wars in Syria and Iraq. In September 2015 he visited Syrian refugees in the Greek island of Lesbos. He has hired refugees from Asia, Africa and the Middle East to work in his yogurt plant in Idaho and New York. He signed the Giving Pledge Act and pledged to donate the majority of his wealth to initiatives for solving the refugee crisis around the world.

Pamela Geller, known for her anti Islam anti immigrant stances, accused Ulukaya of waging what she called "Stealth jihad" wrote on her website:
</h4>
<blockquote>
Stealth jihad in Davos.<br />
The Muslim CEO of yogurt company Chobani urged business elites at Davos to hire Muslim refugees, despite the fact that ISIS previously warned the West that they are sending fighters via migration and the US cannot properly vet them.<br />
Hamdi Ulukaya, founder and CEO of the overpriced Chobani, received commitments from dhimmi companies like Airbnb, LinkedIn, MasterCard, UPS and IKEA to partner with Tent, his “refugee foundation.” Unlike these American companies, Ulukaya need not worry about Muslim workers suing him for prayer rooms, prayer times, or stopping the line for Islamic rituals. He’s Muslim — they won’t hurt him. But mark my words: Airbnb, LinkedIn, MasterCard, UPS and IKEA  will all be the target of Islamic supremacists, like those complaints and suits suffered by Cargill, Disnye, Wal-Mart, Target, Star, Hertz, Heinz, et al.

<h4>Another conservative website wrote:<br /></h4>
<blockquote>
Looking out for his own?
Ulukaya's efforts appear spurred by his own cultural background as a Kurdish Muslim and by a personal visit to the refugee camps in Turkey and Greece.
Ulukaya has told several media outlets that he was horrified by the human suffering he witnessed.
But he said the fact that he shares a cultural affinity with many of the refugees — he grew up near the Syrian border in Turkey, before moving to the U.S. as a student – made an even bigger impact.
