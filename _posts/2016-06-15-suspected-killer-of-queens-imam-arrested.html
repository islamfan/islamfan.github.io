Muslims in the area have been protesting the murder and are asking for more police security around Mosques. A member of the community even criticized New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for not visiting the mosque until now: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
"Itâ€™s been more than 48 hours. The mayor has not been here. If this was a Jewish community, the mayor would be there the next hour."
</blockquote>
