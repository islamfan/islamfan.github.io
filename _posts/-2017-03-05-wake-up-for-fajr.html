the battle with the snooze alarm starts and the classic shaytaan trick “just 5 more minutes ..." begins.
a feeling deep down inside that you’re definitely waking up, and another where you know you won't wake up because deep down inside you don’t want to and you’re not ready to take the fight against shaytaan of waking up in the morning.



<p>
1- Have niyyah / intention
Be sincere, don't fool yourself. 
Reach deep down into your mind and heart and make the intention
think of a time when you had to catch an early flight or a bus/train, and think of how your mind, heart and body were switched on, and it doesn’t matter what time you slept, you’ll wake up.
you hope that you “oversleep” so you feel less guilty about it


2- Ask Allah for help
prayed your witr and pray to Allah sincerly
recite the supplications the prophet used to recite before bed

</p>

<p>
3- Read some Quran before bed
Prophet Muhammad used to recommend that we recite Surat Al-Sajdah, and Surat Al-Mulk (Chapters 32 and 67) before going to sleep.


4- Make Wudu before sleep: 
 Ibn Abbas reported that Allah’s Messenger said: “Purify these bodies and Allah will purify you, for there is no slave who goes to sleep in a state of purity but an Angel spends the night with him, and every time he turns over, [the Angel] says, ‘O Allah! Forgive Your slave, for he went to bed in a state of purity.”

5- Remember the rewards
safe from being a hypocrite, to having light on the day of judgement, to being under Allah’s protection the whole day, to having laziness removed from us that day and being productive.

6- Ask somebody to wake you up
friend/family member, roomate. Encourage each other, talk about it a lot until u get used to wwaking up. make a big deal of it when you both fail to wake up.

7- Respect sleep cycles
Sleep theory says that human sleep cycle is 1.5 hours. At the end of each cycle waking is easier than in the middle of the cycle. Therefore u should make sure you sleep duration is a multiple of 1.5 hours (3, 4.5, 6, 7.5). you’ll wake up fresh and rejuvenated. Otherwise, you’ll wake up lazy. So if fajr is at 5am, and you sleep at 12am, make sure you set your alarm at 4.30am, because that gives you 4.5 hours to sleep. (Of course, if you take 1/2 an hour to fall to sleep, you might need to add that into your calculation).

8- Nap in the afternoon: Another lifehack, taken from the Sunnah and recommended by many, make sure you nap in the afternoon, for just 20 minutes! yup, just 20 minutes. Trust me, for the past 3 years, I’ve mastered the 20 min nap, and everytime it never fails to rejuvenate me. If you need to train yourself to nap for that long, I highly recommend pzizz.com, a wonderful software that trains you for these short naps, it’s what I used to train myself.

9- Reward yourself when you do wake up for fajr
It can be anything, nice breakfast, chocolate, ...
