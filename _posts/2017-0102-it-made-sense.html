Rodwaan Saleh at ISGH River Oaks Islamic Center.
December 22, 2016 at 11:25am · Houston, TX, United States

A call came through ISGH switch board and in a calm professional voice, almost a whisper, the caller asked.. do you have a conversion system in your Mosque?.. silly me, I thought the caller was asking about a Voltage converter for appliances; I don't know.. I thought he was a salesman seeking to make a deal. Hey.. No one called me before and asked about a conversion system.. forgive me O'Allah for I have been silly! :)

It turned out, John (with permission to use his first name), the shortest man I have ever witnessed his Shahadah (smiling), a senior manager with a major international oil company, is the one who called me.

John accepted Islam and proclaimed his "Shahadah" (the Muslim profession of faith (“there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah”), today, at ISGH Main Center.

I asked John, with today's hatred rhetoric on Islam, what drew you to accept it as your way of life.. he paused, fixated a look deeply into my eyes and said: "it made sense"!

At a time when the world beats on hallow drums of hate and spews venomous words of hateful rhetoric towards Islam and Muslims, others heed a message of compassion and forgiveness; truly, Allah guides whom He Loves towards His Deen.

‎إِنَّكَ لَا تَهْدِي مَنْ أَحْبَبْتَ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِي مَن يَشَاءُ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ

Verily! You (O Muhammad SAW) guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are the guided. Quraan:Chapter:28 Verse:56
