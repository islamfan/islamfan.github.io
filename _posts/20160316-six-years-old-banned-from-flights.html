Syed Ahmed is a six years old boy from Canada. He was with his parents at Toronto Pearson airport getting ready for a flight to Edmonton. They were so excited to get to Edmonton attend a family wedding. Ahmed's dad was told that his six years old cannot board the plane because his name is on a list.

According to british newspaper The Independant, the kid's name was on the list of people banned from boarding planes since he was a few months old infant. The reason: his name is similar to some terrorism suspect. The kid's family said that following press reports about the issue, the Canadian minister of Public Safety promised a few months back to review the list and solve the problem. Apprently that has not happened yet and may not be happening anytime soon.
