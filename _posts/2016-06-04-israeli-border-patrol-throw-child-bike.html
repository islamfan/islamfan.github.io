In the city of Hebron in the Palestinian occupied territories, two Israeli border patrol scared an eight years old girl and took away her bike because she was playing with it in a road resererved to settlers. So not only the settlers are stealing palestinian land, now they are steling Palestinian children right to play outside of their homes.

In the video, posted on YouTube by the Israeli rights organization B'Tselem human rights, we see one of the officers, armed, holding the bike with his foot. The girl is still asking him to let go of her bike but then another officer arrives and the girl runs away scared and screaming in tears. He grabs the bike and throws it in a bush nearby.
