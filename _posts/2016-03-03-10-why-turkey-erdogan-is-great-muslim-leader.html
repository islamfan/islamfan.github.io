<p>After the second world war western powers dismantled the ottoman empire and ended the Islamic Caliphate. They made sure that Islam has no role in modern Turkey. Kemal Ataturk who took over power in the new state of Turkey worked hard to make Turkey a secular country. He closed religious schools, religious clothing, switched the Turkish alphabet from Arabic to Latin, changed the call to prayer from Arabic to Turkish and introduced thusands of secular laws.</p>
<p>Before the current ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) many islamic parties tried to restore the role of Islam in Turkey but failed. The military had too much power and wanted the country to stay secular by all means. But things started to incrementally change under the leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and over the years Turkey is returning to its Islamic roots.</p>
<p>Here is why Erdogan is the greatest muslim leader of our times:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;If we are to jump forward we need to grow within a real participation system rather than this cruel one. Islamic financing is a completely different system from the current banking system in terms of its asset-backed structure, its reliance on risk share and its structure closed to speculation. I believe that this system will be the driving force behind the Turkish economy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
