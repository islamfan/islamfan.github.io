<p>Her dad told a newspaper "This conversion is not just bad, but terrible because this religion is too harsh, too radical, too rigid. It is a fundamentalist religion. I am seeing this firsthand, my daughter lives with me. I see it every day. At the time of prayer, she does not even take care of the children and I get angry about it. If a baby cries, it means that he needs something, he needs his mom. I feel a lot of pain for this choice she has made for her life".

She wrote on facebook "The veil is what Allah has chosen for me, I am proud of the purity of my soul. This is the law of God, who am I to oppose it?". Her comments were met with a lot of hostility on social media as most Italians have negative views of islam and Muslims.
