 At a grocery store in Albuquerque, New Mexico a hijabi woman was targeted by another woman who was screaming at her calling her a terrorist and asking her to leave the country. Eyewitnesses say they've heard the attacking lady say "Get out of our country, you don't belong here, you're a terrorist!"

The good thing is that the people in the store did not stand by as the Muslim woman was verbally abused. Many shoppers who heard the altercation walked toward them and intervened to defend the hijabi woman. Barney Lopez who witnessed the situation and was interviewed by TV channel KRQE News 13, said "There was even another woman that like went over to the woman in the hijab and put her arm around her and gave her hug and held her while the Smith’s employees came."

A store employee stood in the way of the screaming woman preventing her from advancing towards the hijabi woman. The other employees escorted the attacker out of the store but she remained in the parking lot waiting for her victim to come to her car. Seeing that the racist woman was determined to cause trouble all the store employees accompnied the hijabi lady to her car.
