How does it feel to meet your mom after 2 years not knowing what happened to her in a village captured by ISIS? This Iraqi police officer knows how it feels. He had to leave his mom behind and run from their village when ISIS captured it in 2014. He had no news about her. It was even worse for his mom because she she didn't know what happened to him: was he captured by ISIS? Did he make it out of the village?

Hugging his mom was not enough he had to go down and kiss her feets.

Most people in the West don't realise that Muslims in the middle east are the ones suffering the most from the atrocities of ISIS.
