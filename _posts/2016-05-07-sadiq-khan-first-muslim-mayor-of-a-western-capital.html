<p>It's final and official: Sadiq Khan has won the election for mayor of London and made history as the first Muslim mayor of a western capital city. Early  Saturday morning the final results were announced and Sadiq won by a landslide 65% against 35% for Zac Goldsmith from the Conservative party. All in all Sadiq got 1,310,143 votes vs 994,614 for his opponent.</p>
<p>Sadiq was always proud of his immigrant muslim background and often reminded people that he was the son of an immigrant bus driver. Sadiq said in a speech after the final results: &#8220;Fear does not make us safer, it only makes us weaker and the politics of fear is simply not welcome in our city.&#8221;</p>
