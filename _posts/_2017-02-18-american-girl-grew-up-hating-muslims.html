I was 16 years old, I lived in a state where most of the people were Protestant Christian fundamentalists. My family name was well known state and even worldwide. I used to go to church every week to pray. I used to listen to them everyday talk about Islam and Muslims. They said that Muslims like killing and bloodshed and that Islam is a religion of violence and terrorism. They said that Muslims were stupid criminals. They have no freedoms and no democracy. They are proud of polygamy (four wives). Having heard all of this I grew up full of hatred and hatred towards this religion without having ever seen a Muslim in my life. From everything I heard about Islam and Muslims the thing that shocked me the most was the "four wives" thing. I was asking myself "Four wives? How? How? How?". Everytime the church service ended and we went back home my mind would start thinking about the things I was hearing, I couldn't control my thoughts. I would try to ignore this subject but still couldn't. Even though I was going to church with my family, I had doubts in my mind that this religion and this prayer we do at church was not the truth. 

In 1984, I was working as a waitress at a restaurant. One day a young brown man ordered breakfast and asked me to tell the chef not to cook the eggs on the same spot where he cooked pork. I said "May I ask why?" and he answered "because I'm a Muslim". I felt like fire going through my body and feared that other customers would notice. I controlled myself and said "Those who marry 4 wives?". He calmly answered "No, Islam is the only religion that says if you cannot be fair then one is enough". I told him "No, No, No, you have to proove this". He said "God willing". I started to get angry again and said "And who is God for you?". He replied "He is the  God, who answered no God but is not a partner. didin't born and didin't have children . It intensified the fire and almost performs Sabri but I am in the workplace. I told him you've got is the Lord Jesus. He answered yes, but the answer needs to be a time and place than this to explain. I still precious to myself why did not I see the things I've heard about them in the church. what happens . Is this true or is it represents. He finished his breakfast and said I'll be back tomorrow, God willing, with evidence.
I went to my house and I'm agnostic What happened to me was thinking and thinking and thinking. When it comes to tomorrow and after tomorrow's awful doom came and went to work waiting for him and I say when it comes to the evidence would not come with evidence they are cowards and criminals, as we have learned. I told my colleagues the subject. Everyone became converts to the sights outside one restaurant says will come and say the other will not come. For your information my colleagues of different religions. During the speech I looked out the glass large nets and I saw him coming, heading to the restaurant and in his hand a book and papers. Became Everyone says I came, I came with him and guide. Guide in his hand. At this moment I do not know what happened to me. Fire turned into something else. I do not want a quieter began the attack. I do not know what happened to me. He entered and threw a salute and all seen from my colleagues and sat down and quickly brought him a cup of tea. Then he took permission from the Director to sit down to discuss the subject with him she said yes, but you have to place him in the box for you. I sat down I asked him how are you and how is your work yesterday did not ask you who you are and from any country and how is your family. And he began to wonder and then ask me for the pain guide said. I told him do not will not ask you about the directory. Exclamation told me I would not educate without trust you and Dar dialogue and I'm thinking is that true. How they are killing people and love the blood and Gdarin also taught me. Is it true I have not seen so far only honesty and good talk. And he began to speak of is the God who spoke with him yesterday and explained to me. I asked if it is from Isa. He answered and explained to me the story. Then delivered to a question was a thunderbolt. He asked me if you have a child and you d explain to them the story of Jesus Which explain to the story. The story, which Tamutaiha in the church or the story that I explained to you right now?
The answer was without hesitation explain to her story, which I explained to me now (in the Qur'an), and the meeting ended on the grounds that it will come to me Islamic books show that Islam is a religion of tolerance religion of love affection religion the religion of truth religion of justice. I went to my family and the House debate between me and them and explained to them what happened. They said Abaadi for this Muslim villain. Stay away from this deadly Muslim. I go back to my family the next day and tell them not evil is not a murderer that he is sincere. They asked me what did he say to you. The great battle. I told them the story of Jesus, who explained to me. He did not go up and sounds of disapproval, threats, and this became the case for two days I was threatened with expulsion from the house I went and explained to him the story and after months grew up poor because they actually agreed that Atrdoe of the house does not give me anything. And I told him and suddenly he told me if I want to marry you. Rang my heart. And immediately I said yes I agree . I went to my mother and brought to their attention, but it did not see my mom crying and saying how I Aosedk so Aallar only daughter, will marry a Muslim What do I do what I say. I told her Ahidoa, Mom has agreed not retreat and I know it has to be the approval of my family because I did not inform the legal age Ki marry without their ear Days later was not before any selection has been married and moved to the house of marriage and I saw a pair Savior who knows how to deal with his wife. Bring me books and tapes Islamic. I never coerce Ali to be a Muslim, but everything in it wishes to see me as a Muslim.
After thinking and conviction, and after several years the most important decision of my life has taken. I'll say it. Will Ontgaha. I will admit. No god but God and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah ... Finally I said it from the depths of my heart. Finally spoken by all convinced. Finally, I've made. I kept crying and crying. Did you cry of joy
