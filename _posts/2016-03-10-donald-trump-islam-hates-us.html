<p>US presidential candidate Donald Trump just added to his big list of controvesial declarations about Islam. Trump received CNN's Anderson Cooper in his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida for an interview. At one point Anderson Cooper asked him if he thinks the US was at war with Islam to which he replied  "I think Islam hates us... There's a tremendous hatred, we have to get to the bottom of it. There is an unbelievable hatred of us... There's a tremendous hatred. And we have to be very vigilant. And we can't allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States and of people that are not Muslim."</p>

<p>Trump is not new to controversy about Islam and Muslims. Back in December 2015, after the terrorist attacks in Paris and California, Trump strongly argued that the United States should ban all Muslims from entering the country. He also suggested building a database of American Muslims.</p>
