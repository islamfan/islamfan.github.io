 According to the Bible, Abraham reached the age of 85 without having children from his wife Sarah who was 76 years old. Sarah offered him to take her servant Hagar as a second wife so he might have children from her. God sent a message to Hagar through an angel: "Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael." Genesis 16: 10-11. Abraham indeed named his newborn Ishmael as commanded by God.

13 years later, the Bible says that God revealed to Abraham that he will be blessed with a son from his wife Sarah and that he will give him Isaac as a name. Abraham got worried for his first son and prayed to God: "O that Ishmael might live before Thee!" And God said to him: "As for Ishmael, I have heard thee. Behold, I have blessed him and I will make him a great nation. But My covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year." Genesis 17: 20-1.

The Bible and Quran differ a bit over when and why Hagar and her son Ishmael had to leave Abraham's household.
The Bible says it was after the birth of Isaac and because Sarah wanted them out. 
The Quran says it was when Ishmael was still a baby and that it was a command from God and does not mention that Sarah told Abraham they should leave. 
TODO {Include here relevant verses from Quran and bible.}
The Bible and the Quran do agree however that it was God's plan in order to make a great nation from Ishmael. Abraham is therefore the father of Christians and Jews through Isaac. He is also the father of Muslims through Ishmael.

Abraham entrusted Hagar and Ishmael to the care of God. By the guidance of God Hagar and her son Ishmael reached the valley of Becca which was on one of the Caravan route known as "the incense route". They were there all alone by themeselves in the middle of the desert with no water. They were overcome by thirst and Hagar was worried for her son. She run 7 times between two points of vantage trying to find someone to help but in vain. Genesis 21:17-20 says:
<blockquote>
"And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to
Hagar out ofheaven and said to her: What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not,
for God hath heard the voice ofthe lad where he is. Arise and lift up the
lad and hold him in thy hand, for I will make him a great nation. And
God opened her eyes, and she saw a well ofwater"
</blockquote>

The well mentioned in the previous verse was a spring that came later to be known as Zamzam. Thanks to this water the valley of Becca became a resting place for caravans and later developed into a town.

When Ishmael was 13 years old, God showed Abraham where to find him and his mother and he came to visit them. God also instructed him to build a sanctuary near the well of Zamzam.
