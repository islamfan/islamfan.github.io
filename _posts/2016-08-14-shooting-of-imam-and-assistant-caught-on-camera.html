<p>
Queens, New York - Surveillance camera captured the tragic event of yesterday Saturday in which a suspect killed an imam and his assistant by shooting them in the head. Imam Alala Uddin Akongi and his assistant Thara Uddin had just finished dohr prayers at Al Furqan Jame Masjid walking. The video footage shows both men waling when all of a sudden another man comes rushing behind them and in less than 5 seconds shoots them both in the heads and leaves on foot.
</p>

<p>From the video it appears clearly that this was definetly not a robbery as the gunman did not try to steal anything from the 2 mens after they fell to the ground. His goal was killing and he made sure he got both of them before leaving. Police were distributing and hanging flyers with a portrait of the suspect and asking people to provide them details to help them make an arrest.</p>

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio had this to say about the shooting.
</p>
<blockquote> 
"This weekend our city was stung by violence that devastated a congregation and unsettled a community, When religious leaders are targeted, we all bear the pain those in Ozone Park feel most personally today. While we do not yet know the motivation for the murders of Maulama Akonjee and Thara Uddin, we do know that our Muslim communities are in the perpetual crosshairs of bigotry. It remains critical that we work to bridge the divides that threaten to undermine the greatness of our city and country. Rest assured that our NYPD will bring this killer to justice."
