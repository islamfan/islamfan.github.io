Addressing the European Parliament's justice and home affairs committee on April 25, 2016, Mr Koen Geens, the Belgian minister of justice, declared that <strong>"Europe will soon count more Muslims than Christians"</strong>. He added  that "Europe does not realise it yet but it is the truth". The deputy Prime Minister of Belgium who also holds the post of Interior Minister, Mr Jan Jambon later supported his colleague by saying <strong>"I have said a thousand times, the worst thing we can do is to make an enemy of Islam. That is the very worst thing we could do. We have 600,000 to 700,000 Muslims in Belgium and the overwhelming majority of those people share our values. To make an enemy of all of those people, we really will be creating problems.</strong>
</p>

<p>In April 2015 the American think tank Pew Research Center of Washington published a study that projected the growth of major religious groups in Europe between the years 2010 and 2050. The study found that le number of Muslims in Europe (including Ukraine and Russia) would increase by 63%. It also found that the number of Christians would decrease by an astonishing 100 million people.</p>

<p>The study explained its findings by the fact that <strong>"Muslims have a younger population and a higher fertility rate (2.1 children per woman) than any other major religious group. Furthermore, ongoing immigration from the Middle East, Africa and Asia is expected to stoke growth."</strong></p>
