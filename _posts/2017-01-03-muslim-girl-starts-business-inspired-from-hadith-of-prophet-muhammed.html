<h4>
<p>25 years old Zobaida Falah is the founder of CURE M, a nutritional bar company inspired by the hadith of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):<br /> 
<blockquote>
"This black seed is a cure for every disease except death."<br />
[Saheeh al-Bukharee (5687)].
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The nutritional bar she calls the cure bar is made from 9 all natural ingredients: Honey, Almonds, Oats, Sesame Seeds, Chia Seeds, Puffed Millets, Black Cumin Seeds, Organic Coconut Oil and Sea Salt. She started the company in Toledo Ohio. For each cure bar sold the company donates one bar to a needy person. She believes that this simple act of giving can have an impact on the world.
