<p>
After last Wednesday's attacks in Tel Aviv where 2 palestinians killed four and injured sixteen, the last thing Israelis want to hear is that occupation is the source of these attacks. But that's exactly what they heard from Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai. 
</p>
<p>
In an interview Thursday morning, the Mayor told Army Radio that "There is no way to hold people in a situation of occupation and think that they will reach the conclusion that everything is OK and they will continue to live like that". He added that Israel is "perhaps the only country in the world holding another nation under occupation without civil rights". He added "On the one hand the occupation has lasted 49 years, and I took part in it. I recognize the reality and know that leaders with courage must look to take action and not just talk. The fact that we are suffering does not lead to a change in understanding of what must be done ... There is no courage to do what needs to be done in order to reach a [peace] agreement." and Israel is "perhaps the only country in the world holding another nation under occupation without civil rights."

This is not the first time an Israeli politician spoke the truth about the source of Palestinian attacks. In 1998, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said that if he had been born a Palestinian, he might have joined one of the groups fighting Israel.
