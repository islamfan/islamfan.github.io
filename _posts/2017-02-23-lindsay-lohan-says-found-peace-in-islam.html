<p>Hollywood star Lindsay Lohan said in a interview Tuesday with British TV show Good Morning Britain that "Studying the Quran is something I found solace in, a religion where I found a lot of peace."</p>

<p>Lohan made clear that she had not converted to Islam yet but her words seem to indicate that she is seriously studying the religion and want to be sure before taking that step. She told GMB "You can't just convert to a religion overnight. It's a culture and practice. I don't want to comment on something I haven't finished".</p>

<p>Rumors about her conversion to Islam are not new. They were sparked by different things that occured over the last couple of years. In May 2015 pictures of her holding the Quran made the news. A couple of months ago she deleted almost everything from her Twitter and Instagram accounts. The Muslim greeting "Alaikum salam" can be seen next to her name on Instagram. She was seen and photographed wearing a headscarf many times.</p>

Speaking of the headscarf, Lohan told the TV show that she was "racially profiled" by Heathrow airport security for wearing a headscarf. The incident happened when she arrived to London from Turkey and was asked by airport security to remove her headscarf. She added "How would another woman who doesn't feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?" </p>
