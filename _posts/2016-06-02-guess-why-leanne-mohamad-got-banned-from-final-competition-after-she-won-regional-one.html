        </p>
<p>A British Palestinian girl was banned from the finals of a prestigious youth public speaking competition in the UK. The girl, 15 years old Leanne Mohamad, had previously won the Redbridge regional youth public competition in London on May 19th where she spoke about the injustices faced by the Palestinian people under Israeli occupation. She ended her speech by waving a small Palestinian flag and shouting "Let's together all say Free Palestine".</p>

<p>Shortly after her win the video of her speech went viral on the web and people showed a lot of support. But some dark forces got involved  at some point and something radical happened: The article that announced Leanne's win was removed from Speak out Challenge's official website (www.speakoutchallenge.com) and the speech video removed from their official YouTube channel. Not only that but Leanne was not on the list of the 15 regional winners qualified for the finals.</p>

<p>Of course we are in 2016 and thanks to social media this stuff does not go unnoticed. The internet was angry: Hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LetLeanneSpeak">#LetLeanneSpeak</a> was attracting a lot of attention, people launched an online petition on <a href="https://www.change.org/p/jack-petchey-foundation-uncensor-british-palestinian-award-winning-schoolgirl?source_location=search_index&algorithm=promoted&grid_position=4Sign">change.org</a> asking to uncensor the schoolgirl. On may 31st A joint statement from "Speakers Trust" and the "Jack Petchey Foundation" who run the competition stated that the video of Leanne’s speech was removed because of "vile and hateful comments posted online" and for her own protection.
</p>
			  
<p>You can read the whole statement here or just read the most relevant parts below:<br />
<blockquote>On 19th May Leanne Mohamad from Wanstead High School was chosen from among 19 finalists as the 2015/6 Redbridge Regional Final winner. She was chosen by an independent panel of judges.<br />
As a Regional Final winner the speech was posted online. Following vile and hateful comments posted online during this Bank Holiday weekend Speakers Trust removed the video of Leanne’s speech. We will not tolerate trolling of young people. As a small charity without the capacity to moderate comments 24 hours a day it was considered essential to protect Leanne by temporarily suspending the regional video until we were able to consult fully with her school and family.<br />
In terms of progression in the competition – all 37 talented Regional Final champions were entered into the semi-final on Saturday 21st May. Only 15 of these can reach the Grand Final stage. A panel of judges selected the top 15 speeches without any external influence or input and prior to any of the issues that emerged this weekend. The general “rules” of effective public speaking in the Challenge are guidelines to help speakers to create a speech that will connect with a large and diverse audience and every speech was judged on its own merits.<br />
All the young people who were selected were  notified in the week after 21st May. Leanne Mohamad was not selected. She does however remain the Redbridge Regional Winner for 2016.<br />
Both the Jack Petchey Foundation and Speakers Trust which runs the Challenge have a primary duty of care to the young people we work with and we cannot accept any form of abuse against them.<br />
We are determined that all of our young speakers, irrespective of background, race or religion, should be able to speak out in a safe and supportive environment.  In our society people have the right to hold and express different views or perspectives. It is important that young people can express these, challenge and question in an appropriate manner and learn to live with each other in peace.<br />

<p>Wow, that's a nice statement, right? Convincing and fair. But again we are in 2016 and you cannot hide the truth with nice words. The reality is that Speakers Trust was pressured to silence Leanne Mohamad and disqualify her from the finals. Here is a letter that an anti-Palestinian activist Edgar Davidson addressed to Speakers Trust:<br />
<blockquote>
Dear Ms Griffiths,<br /><br />

I have been a long term supporter of the Jack Petchey Foundation [personal details were added here].  What I was not aware of was that the Charity was now in the business of supporting vicious blood libels against the State of Israel.<br /><br />

Specifically, I have watched the speech by Leanne Mohamad of Wanstead High School  that won the 2015-16 Jack Petchey “Speak Out” Challenge Redbridge Regional Final. This speech consists of three minutes of solid lies and blood libels claiming that every day since 1948 (when the State of Israel was established) the ‘defenceless’ Palestinians have been slaughtered, with 30,000 children murdered.<br /><br />

For the record there are no verified instances of Palestinian children being ‘murdered’ by Israel, although many dozens have died as a result of Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist groups launching unprovoked rocket attacks against Israeli civilians (often from schools and hospitals) and then using their own children as human shields when Israel has responded. In fact, Amnesty International (an organisation that has traditionally been hostile to Israel) reported just this week that most of the child casualties of the 2014 conflict (that was started by Hamas) were actually killed by Hamas rockets falling short of their ‘target’.  In contrast, there have been several hundred Israel children murdered by Palestinian terrorists who all operate as part of ‘official’ groups (Hamas, Fatah, and Islamic Jihad) and each such murder is a cause of rejoicing in the Palestinian territories. A catalogues of the most recent murders can be found here. Three especially brutal examples you should read up about are:the Ma’alot School massacre; the Haifa school bus massacre; and the Fogel family massacre.<br /><br />

As for the lie that Palestinian children cannot sleep because they are ‘bombed every night’, perhaps Ms Mohamad is actually thinking of the Jewish children of Sderot who really were bombed almost every day between 2005 and 2014 by the Palestinians of Gaza.<br /><br />

You must surely be aware that supporting hateful and vicious political propaganda puts the Jack Petchey Foundation in breach of its Charity Commission obligations as made clear in the Commission’s document here.<br /><br />

Before I make a formal complaint to the Charities Commission I would like to know what the Charity is going to do about it and, in particular, whether and when it plans to at least put the record straight for the children of Wanstead High School, in terms of ensuring they hear the truth about what is happening in 'Palestine'.<br /><br />

The response from Speakers Trust CEO says it all:
<blockquote>
Thank you very much for your email, which my colleague Rebecca Griffiths has this morning forwarded to me. We take your concerns very seriously.<br /><br />

Every year thousands of young people are trained in the art of public speaking. They are encouraged to speak out on something they feel passionately about and of course they bring with them their history and culture and beliefs.<br /><br />

There are, however, two fundamental rules that are made explicit during the training: <br />
– the speech must have a positive and uplifting message – in fact this is one of the core terms of the agreement with the Jack Petchey Foundation. <br />
– a speaker should never inflame or offend the audience or insult others and this, by definition, means that propaganda is ruled out absolutely from the outset.<br /><br />

It is, however, the school that votes through its most talented speaker in an Assembly final and an independent panel of judges from the local community who select their regional winner. Speeches at this level will have been further developed and even rewritten, with the training guidelines but without our input on content. Judges do not mark a speaker down because they disagree with a point of view but they are clearly briefed on the those guidelines. Unfortunately, with over 18,000 young people trained annually, a speech that does not observe these ground rules may very rarely get through on passion and delivery.<br /><br />

Last Saturday a Speakers Trust and Jack Petchey Foundation judging panel decided unanimously against sending Leanne Mohamad through to the next stage and she will not be speaking at the Grand Final. These were precisely our concerns.<br /><br />

As a Speakers Trust trainer I was responsible for managing the schools in Redbridge and I have a close affinity with the region. Please let me know if you would like me to forward your email to Wanstead High School so that your comments and reservations may be heard. <br /><br />

If you wish to discuss this further you have my home office number below, which you are welcome to use at any time.<br /><br />

Kind regards, <br />
Julie Holness <br />
Chief Executive Officer<br />
