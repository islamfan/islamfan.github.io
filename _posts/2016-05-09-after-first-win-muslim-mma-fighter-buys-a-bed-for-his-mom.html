Islam has given parents a prestigious position in society. Many verses in the Quran and many hadiths of the prophet Mohammed (pbuh) cammand muslims to treat their parents with absolute respect and to take care of them under all circumstances.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<em>We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents; in pain did his mother bear him, and in pain did she give him birth. (Quran 46:15).
</em>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<em>
Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to parents. Whether one or both of them attain old age in your life, say not to them a word of contempt, nor repel them, but address them in terms of honor. (Quran 17:23)
</em>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<em>
The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is reported to have said: Your Heaven lies under the feet of your mother (Ahmad & Nasai).
</em>
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<em>
A man came to the Prophet and said, ‘O Messenger of God! Who among the people is the most worthy of my good companionship? The Prophet said: Your mother. The man said, ‘Then who?' The Prophet said: Then your mother. The man further asked, ‘Then who?' The Prophet said: Then your mother. The man asked again, ‘Then who?' The Prophet said: Then your father. (Bukhari & Muslim).
