<h4>In a video by <i>AJ+</i> an armed group of activists from Irving Texas said they use pigs' blood and bacon grease on bullets so that any Muslims they shoot will "go straight to hell".
<p>The armed group calls itself the <b>Bureau of Islamic Relations. </b> and believes that a Muslim uprising in Texas is imminent in the near future and will be modeled on the events of teh Arab spring. The reporter from <i>AJ+</i> got in touch with militants from the BAIR group and accompanied them to a place where they practice shooting their guns.</p>
<p>In the video BAIR spokesman David Wright says "A lot of us here are using either pig's blood or bacon grease on our bullets, packing it in the middle, so that when you shoot a Muslim, they go straight to hell. That's what they believe in their religion". No Mr David, that's not what Muslims believe in their religion, that what you believe in your ignorant big head. No such a thing exists in any religious book of Islam. Another member of the group is heard saying "Don't fuck with white people".</p>

<p>Later in the video BAIR spokesman David Wright continues "The next step in Jihad does not involve random, sporadic attacks. They start killing people. They start slaughtering people wholesale. Do you really expect me to stand here and wait until we get to that point. I'm not going to wait until we get to that point. I'm going to start doing something about it now."</p>
