The Hollywood Walk of Fame comprises more than 2500 terrazzo and brass stars embedded in the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, California. The stars are permanent public monuments honoring the achievements of important public figures. The only star that is not embedded in the ground is that of Muhammad Ali. Instead it is placed high on a wall near the entrance to the Dolby Theatre.

When Muhammad Ali was honored with the star in 2002 he did not want people to walk the name if the Prophet Muhammad. He said:
</p>
<blockquote> 
"I bear the name of our beloved Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and it is impossible that I allow people to trample over his name."
</blockquote>

<p>
Muhammad Ali died during the night of Friday June 3, 2016. He was 74 years old.
