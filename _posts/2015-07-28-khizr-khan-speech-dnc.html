<p>At the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, Mr Khizr Khan, the father of an American Muslim soldier killed in combat in 2004 in Iraq made an impassioned plea in favor of Hillary Clinton against the anti-Muslim anti-immigrant rhetoric of Donald Trump, her Republican opponent for the White House.</p>

<p>Khizr Khan electrified the crowd of Democratic delegates when he said:</p>
<blockquote>Hillary Clinton was right when she called my son "the best of America."
If it was up to Donald Trump, he never would have been in America.. Donald Trump consistently smears the character of Muslims. He disrespects other minorities, women, judges, even his own party leadership. He vows to build walls and ban us from this country., a lancé Khizr Khan, électrisant la foule des délégués démocrates.

<p>The Republican candidate promised last December to ban Muslims from entering US territory.<br />
Waving a copy of the US Constitution Khizr Khan said:
</p>
<blockquote>"Donald Trump, you are asking Americans to trust you with their future. Let me ask you: Have you even read the U.S. Constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words "liberty" and "equal protection of law." 
Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of the brave patriots who died defending America — you will see all faiths, genders, and ethnicities.
You have sacrificed nothing and no one."
</blockquote>
