Doctor Abdulrahman El-Sayed is running for the post of governor of Michigan. If he succeeds he will be the first Muslim to become state governor in the history of the United States.
</p>

<p>
He told the news website mic.com "I'm not running to be the first Muslim governor. I'm running because I believe I will be the best governor for the state of Michigan, whether or not I'm Muslim."

When asked about his Muslim faith and how it can be a liability in the current climate of rethoric and hate towards Muslims in the US he said: 
<blockquote>
"My faith is really important to me, as it is for many Americans and Michiganders. But I think we should be asking ourselves rather than how one prays, or what they pray to, we should ask ourselves what [one] prays for and what one hopes for."
</blockquote>

In a speech as part of his campaign for governor, El-Sayed said: 
<blockquote>
"My focus is, has always been, and will always be people. My work has always been about building and leading the kinds of institutions that create opportunities for real people by breaking down the barriers that they face in their lives to being able to have the opportunity we want for my children. That work has never been more important than it is today. I am running because of the values my Islam teaches me — which includes beliefs in equity, the fundamental rights of all people, a belief that we will judge ourselves as a people based on how we treat the most vulnerable. A belief in being good to others fundamentally, a belief in respect and dignity to one’s neighbors and one’s friends and one’s family. This idea of America is so much bigger than anyone."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
Referring to the oppressive regime ruling Egypt currently, he said: 
<blockquote>
"I know what it looks like to live in a country that doesn’t respect fundamental civil rights or pluralism, equity or care for the most vulnerable. I only have to think of my cousins who don’t have what I have, because they weren’t lucky enough to be born in the country I was born in. It’s why America is an idea I fight for."
