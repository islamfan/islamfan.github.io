This guy thought he was going to get away with making the fool and trying to make Mulsim students loose focus during their salat. What he didn't know is that there is a special rule in Islam that says you cannot walk in front of somebody while he's making salat. There is even a requirement for the one who is making salat to stop anybody walking in front of him. The poor guy was definetly not prepared for this knock down MMA style.
