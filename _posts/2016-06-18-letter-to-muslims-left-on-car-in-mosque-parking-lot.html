<h3>Muslims attending the Majid at British Colombia in Canada were in for a pleasant surprise when they found a note on the windshield of a car in the Mosque's parking lot. It was from an American citizen who lives in Canada and who apparently was not happy with all the negativity about Muslims in American media. The letter shows that not all Americans have hatred towards Muslims.<br>
</h3>
</p>
<p>Here is the text of the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>&#8220;Hello &amp; God Bless you. You don&#8217;t know me but I am an American who happens to live in Canada. I needed to tell you for myself &#8211; As much as for my country, I am SORRY for what is being said about your faith on our media (over &amp; over). I just wanted to say not ALL Americans are filled with so much hatred. With much respect and LOVE, please forgive the rhetoric coming from the USA. I am studying Islam &amp; find the faith honourable and loving.</p>
	<p>Please be strong and know you have the love &amp; support of many American Christians. even after this tragedy in Florida &#8211; the answer is always love.</p>
	<p>Thank you for letting me express my sorrow for the unwanted vilification of your faith which is so full of LOVE. May our creator bless your Church [Mosque].&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
